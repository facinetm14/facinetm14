<h1>Hi There👋</h1>

<p>I'm Facinet, from Guinea🇬🇳 actualy living in Germany.</br>

In my country we love football⚽ , it was even my dream to become a profesional player⛹🏼</br>
After my high school, I didn't even know which field choose🤷🏽‍♂️.</br>
I just went for Networks & telecoms because I knew a guy who's a telecom Engineer.</br>
During the first year, a common core, I discovered computer science and realised my laptop is not
for gaming or watching movies🎮🎞️.</p>

<p>I was very fascinated by the programming topics like my name (Facinet)😄</br>
My love and passion for coding comes from there and today it's my profession.
I am constantly learning and developing and I love it❤️.</p>

<p>My dream today is to become the software engineer who appears to me every day in my dreams when I'm sleeping.</br>
<p>I would be happy to talk to you about him but meantime here are facts about me</p>
