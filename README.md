<h1>Hi There👋</h1>

<p>I'm <strong>Facinet</strong>, from Guinea &#x1F1EC;&#x1F1F3;, actualy studying Software Engineering💻 at <a href="https://42wolfsburg.de/">42 wolfsburg</a>.</br>

In my country we love football⚽ , it was even my dream to become a profesional player (Goleador)</br>
After my high school, I didn't even know which field choose🤷‍♂️.</br>
I just went for Networks & telecoms because I knew a guy who's a telecom Engineer.</br>
During the first year, a common core, I discovered computer science and realised my laptop is not
for gaming or watching movies🎮🎞️.</p>

<p>I was very fascinated by the programming topics like my name (Facinet)😄</br>
My love and passion for coding comes from there and today it's my profession.
I am constantly learning, growing and I love it❤️.</p>
